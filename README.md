# Three.js Scene with React

This project is a minimal setup for using Three.js within a React application. It sets up a simple Three.js scene and renders it into a React component.

## Project Structure

The main files and directories for this project are:

```
your-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ThreeScene.js
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

Here is a brief overview of each:

### `public/index.html`

This is the main HTML page that is served when someone visits your site. The div with id 'root' inside this file is the entry point to your React app. The rest of the HTML file provides important metadata to the browser and sets the page title.

### `src/index.js`

This is the entry point to your React application. It imports the React and ReactDOM libraries, as well as the main App component. It uses the `ReactDOM.createRoot()` method to create a root React fiber, and then the `root.render()` method to render the React app into the `div` with id "root" in the "index.html" file.

### `src/App.js`

This file defines the main App component. The App component imports and renders the `ThreeScene` component, which is wrapped in a `div` with a class of "App".

### `src/ThreeScene.js`

This is where the Three.js scene is created and manipulated. It defines a `ThreeCanvas` React component. In the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method, it sets up the Three.js scene, creates and animates a mesh, and adds it to the scene. It also manages loading of textures and shaders using the THREE.LoadingManager, and creates a material using the loaded texture, which is then applied to the mesh.

## Usage

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
npm install
```

### Running the App

To start the application, run:

```
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

This project is a basic integration of Three.js within React. For complex projects, consider using a wrapper library like [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to better integrate Three.js within the React environment.
